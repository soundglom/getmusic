The most innovative Flamenco dancer of her generation, Melissa Cruz, brings her legendary fiery footwork magic to the stage along with the beautiful Afro-Cuban, and Afro Haitian dance expressions of the talented Anya De Marie, with dance that combines Rumba, Sevillanas, soul, Afro-Haitian, and more.   This is a group that could only have happened here, as one sensory experience will prove.

Featuring Zero Zero (UK) and Joey Mojo\"  Take back your freedoms and join us for our Drum and Bass monthly right here in the East Bay - Dystopia, every fourth Friday in the heart of Oakland, California. Come get 'baptized' to the sounds of Drum & Bass champions from all over the sprawl and indoctrinated by the verses of our MC's!  APRIL equals COLOSSAL talent that we are pleased to welcome for our 68th installment.    ︻╦╤─ ︻╦╤─ FREE YOUR SELF on APRIL 22ND ─╤╦︻ ─╤╦︻   This month’s AUDIO CHAMPIONS:   ★ ZEROZERO (EVOL INTENT | BROKEN AUDIO | CHEEKY MONDAY | UK) ★  Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/zerozerodnb  Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/zerozerodnb/   ZeroZero is a Drum & Bass duo consisting of Sam from Jersey and Jesse from London, both based in Amsterdam working as Audio Engineers, Producers and DJs. With releases on labels such as; Evol Intent Recordings, Mindtech Recordings, Liondub, Soul Rebel and DJ residencies at Cheeky Monday and Vanguard Audio, as well as positions as Head Engineers at Amsterdam’s Red Bull Studios, the pair are constantly working on several different musical projects at once. Currently working closely with the bass prodigy Teknian, they have a number of tracks lined up for release in 2016 along with collaborations with other exciting producers that have yet to be revealed. Supported by artists such as Reso, Spor, Evol Intent, JFB, B Traits, Bachelors of Science, Dave Owen, Calculon, Champion, Skandandbass, Adi-J and receiving plays on BBC Radio 1 and 1xtra, ZeroZero are writing music that appeals to fans of all the various DnB sub-genres. Their sound is heavily influenced by their love for funk, deep basslines and technical sound design as well as the musicality you’d expect from a duo with a background in playing live instruments. ZeroZero have big plans for 2016 with releases forthcoming on labels such as ProgRAM, Broken Audio, Bass=Win and Code Recordings, forthcoming sample packs for Prime Loops, and shows booked in Holland, UK, USA, Mexico and Canada so far. Their 4 deck DJ sets are fast paced, combine all styles of DnB and are packed with their own exclusive tracks, bootlegs and edits, making them an exciting addition to any lineup.   ★ JOEY MOJO (SMOKIN TEES) ★   Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/joey-mojo  Mixcloud: https://www.mixcloud.com/JoeyMojo/  Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/djjoeymojo/   With over 15 years’ experience in DJing, Joey Mojo has taken the electronica scene by storm. He prides himself in his eclectic musical choices and DJing styles, playing anything from dubwise, jump up, bassline, liquid, jungle and reggae/dancehall, on two, but sometimes even three turntables. His incredible track selection, coupled with his high energy and intricate scratching, helped him land his most prestigious job, as DJ for the Cheech & Chong’s North American Tour. Even though that job has completed, he hasn’t slowed down and plays out as often as he can. Joey Mojo is currently residing in Los Angeles, California and working as an audio engineer.   ★ M27 (OUTLET | NICEONES | BABY DONKEY) ★  Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/m27  From his background in Los Angeles hip-hop culture, fuses the skill set of a classic turntablist with his love of euphoric 90s rave music. With a selection of roots hardcore and jungle, he cuts, chops, and serves jungle breaks on a pair of classic technics turntables and Vestax battle mixer. M27 moved to the Bay Area in late 2011 after a long stint in Los Angeles working with Futurebound Radio and the Back to Basics jungle monthly. M27 curates Ruff Tapes out of Oakland, California which is a D.I.Y. mix-tape and mix-cd label. Primarily focusing on underground rave music still being freshly mixed...from jungle,house,acid,hardcore,breakcore..to 89' revival, hip hop turntablism, breaks, noise and more. M27 is active across the state playing alongside fellow heavy hitters in the underground.   ★ MERAKI (OUTLET | OTD | SOUND SYSTEM SYNDICATE) ★  Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/merakidj  Meraki touched wax for the first time when he was 12 years old and since has been blessed to share music in the majority of states in the USA. Meraki has a wide spanning passion for mixing that reaches far beyond any one musical genre or dance floor. He was born into a family of musicians and approached mixing music as something musical and applies many aspects of key theory as well as phrasing into his mixing style. Meraki has been able to support artist such as; The Crystal Method, Gridlok, Maztek, Shiny Toy Guns, Tritonal, Calvertron, Gammer, Dj S3rl, Figure, Bare, and Dj Impact (UK) to name a few.   ★ M.DAMNage (TOUCH BASS) ★  Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/mikedamnage   Rockin Heavy, Phat, Grimey Bass Rhythms from the heaviest hitters in Drum & Bass and Dubstep. Holdin’ it down for San Jose, California.

        "text": " **1st FRIDAY CRUISE PARTY*** \nFrom 10pm to 1am  Are you looking for something new on the First Friday's party menu?  If so we've got that covered for you!  Join iVM1 Entertainment as we present First Fridays On The Bay, a place where the GROWN & SEXY can mix mingle and get their groove on all night long!   So get ready to hop aboard as we cruise from the Bay to the City, and party under the stars.  But while you're cruising, you'll be grooving as Dj Ball-D keeps the boat  rocking, with the latest and greatest hits to keep those speakers knocking.  The cost for this event is $25 at the dock, so get there early to lock in your spot.   As always the event is for the GROWN & SEXY crowd so there will be no drama allowed.   Loading time will be at 9:40pm.  Embarcadero and Broadway  Behind Plank's   Jack London Sq N Oakland   FOLLOW ME ON I.G  CAPTNBLAKE    Hope to see you on deck! \n  \n  \nWe \"MUST\" leave on time and keep on schedule folks. The boat will not wait for you so please arrive extra early to get good parking and familiarize yourselves with the area. There are big parking lots in the Jack London Square area close to our departing place, and public parking on the streets, but can be busy with the many restaurants and shops so please prepare. There are many places to eat & drink by the nearby boat boarding location after you park so coming early is highly recommended to situate yourselves, avoid any stress, and grab a drink or a bite to eat in this beautiful area while you're waiting.    ((( BOAT DEPARTURE ADDRESS ))) ~>>> 1 BROADWAY, OAKLAND, CA 94607  \n...in the Jack London Square (area of Oakland) at the very end of Broadway Street (also next to Lungomare restuarant - in case you need another reference).   \n*Boat returns at 1:00am.   *Please remember to bring your PHOTO ID's to be checked thru security and for ticket purchase confirmation. Please bring your ticket print-outs (if possible). *If you have bought multiple tickets, please have these persons with you on arrival before entering the boat to avoid confusion! This is a 21+ event.  About the boat: \"Bay Celebrations\" is a locally owned, double decked riverboat style vessel powered by twin engines. The boat is wheel chair accessible and features a full bar and indoor / outdoor areas. The boat moves slowly for maximum comfort and will tour the lovely waters of the SF Bay with viewings of the Bay Bridge, Golden Gate Bridge, and Alcatraz. This boats' capacity is 145 people.  *We highly recommend that you eat a good full meal before arriving to the boat keep your tummies full during the entire boat ride. Alcohol on an empty stomach is no bueno! There will many beverages (water, alcohol, soda, juice, etc.) sold at the 2 boat bars. We strongly suggest bringing a thick jacket as it can get chilly & windy during the evening hours and out on the deck. No backpacks and only good vibes on this journey... Let's have some fun!

Oakland Ca 94612 \n\nKEEF BROWN  \nKeef Brown is a 29 year old MC from Richmond, California. An alumnus of Grambling State University, this master craftsman when writing and performing is a self proclaimed contemporary urban griot with a penchant for words of purpose who places a premium on the craft of English language arts. He has been writing and performing since 2008 and just recently began displaying his battle rap skills in competitions throughout the Bay Area. This explosive artist brings heat to every microphone he steps to and is guaranteed to leave you with a little piece of his soul once he spits his last word. \n\nD'DRA WHITE  \nWriter, Poet, Spoken Word Artist D'dra White is the breath of fresh air you didn’t know you were missing. Armed with a smile, and the knowledge that this is her calling, D’dra is an empath, using poetry to tell the stories of those who forgot that they had a story to tell. In the slam/spoken word arena, she has enjoyed some successes: \n\nMember of the 2009 San Francisco Slam Team (which finished 3rd in the Nation) and the only member of the team to perform individual pieces in every round of competition. \nWinner of the 2010 \"School of Slam\" invitational. \nFounding Member of the Bay Area All-Stars (the first Bay Area writing collective to tour Hawaii). \nCohost/Curator/Slammaster of an Award nominated Open mic/Slam (Golden State Slam and Open-mic). \nOne of five women poets selected to perform on Season Two of Verses and Flow (the only season the show was nominated for an NCAAP Image Award). \nD'dra has performed all over the country and shared the stage with notable talents like Anthony David, Prentice Powell, Sonya Renee Taylor, and Talaam Acey to name a few. \nWhen not on stage, D'dra can be found mentoring and teaching spoken word classes for young people while rocking the flyest of earrings. \n\nDARTH TONE  \nDarth Tone is an emcee from the Biggest Little Town in the world, Reno, Nevada. He possesses a style wholly original and unique to himself. When in the booth under the imprint of Vaded Nation he is calm, reflective, and introspective. However within the emcee battle culture, Tone turns vicious with a lyrical prowess marked by witty wordplay and aggressive delivery. \n\n\nDOM JONES  \n \nDom Jones, from Oakland CA, is a 2nd semester voice principal at the prestigious Berklee College of music in Boston. A ferocious emcee, Dom is also an impressive singer/songwriter. An International Songwriting Competition Winner in 2014, Dom released her first album, Wingspan that same year. In addition to writing for The Berklee Groove, Dom is a 2016 Writing Fellow for Forbes 30 under 30 recognized publication, Blavity.
